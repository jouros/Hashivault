# Hashivault

In this demo lab I will focus on Kubernetes integration for Hashicorp Vault, this is not production ready deployment e.g. secrets persistent storage is not configured. 

This demo is installed on WSL2

Ubuntu cloud init will deploy Hashi vault and 'vault' regular user account. For Ansible I have deployed 'management' user account with sudo, example below: 

```text
management@hashivault:~$ sudo su
root@hashivault:/home/management# su vault
vault@hashivault:/home/management$ cd
vault@hashivault:~$ pwd
/home/vault
vault@hashivault:~$ id
uid=1001(vault) gid=1002(vault) groups=1002(vault),100(users)
```

Preparing hashi repo for Ubuntu cloudimage seed config:
```text
wget https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg -O hashi.key
gpg --list-packets hashi.key | awk '/keyid:/{ print $2 }'
AA16FCBCA621E701

```

## Test Vault in Dev mode

Dev Mode run in shell foreground:
```text
vault@hashivault:~$ vault server -dev
==> Vault server configuration:

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
LOGS HERE
WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variables:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: YsTbXCBD9vLzCE6dN6g3lX28Xr7CB2lku+LGeyowq/4=
Root Token: hvs.CMHQAeX563xOfxRgf6WnmhON

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!

Important things to notice at this point:
```text
'Seal Type       shamir' Seal type Shamir means that 'Unseal Key' is split into 'Total Shares' amount of keys. In Dev mode only only one key. 
'Total Shares    1'      How many parts 'Unseal Key' has
'Unseal Key'             Key to open Vault before serving requests                 
'Root Token'             root authentication token         
'Initialized     true'   Vault has started
'Sealed          false'  Vault secrets are in system memory and available for requests
```

Vault remote web browser UI test from WSL2 Ubuntu, first lets install Firefox, WSL2 has direct X support:
```text
# snap install firefox
firefox 122.0-2 from Mozillaâœ“ installed
$ firefox &
```

Vault is listening localhost, so lets have a redirect: 
```
$ socat TCP4-L:8300,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:127.0.0.1:8200
```

After above steps you can open Vault GUI from Firefox browser and log in using root token.


## Configure Vault 

I'm are going to use selfsigned customer certificate, so /etc/vauld.d/vault.hcl need modification:
```text
 # HTTPS listener
listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "/opt/vault/tls/custom.crt"
  tls_key_file  = "/opt/vault/tls/custom.key"
}
```
